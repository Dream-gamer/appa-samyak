    "transcriptions = \"wordsspeaker00 No we plan not in that situation also usually I didnt say like I dont have that kind of dont have that kind of work that Yes so mostly like it is not there now but in the past it used to be around that we have to think about the problem statement test So too many things too many angles to talk to be thought about So So usually like it requires a lot of attention and deep work kind of situation right Just open like start and then because it was probably not perfect I would just go back to Twitter or WhatsApp or LinkedIn Got it And then get back and then again go back and so So the mental energy Then my solution later sometimes was just here Kuch bhi ho bas likhna chalu kar do TikTok khol ke And then it will work out it After some time I would start doing that Just open a doc start writing whatever thoughts and then create a structure first and then go through each part later But basically without any expectations just start writing work for me Monday and Tuesday I dont do it at work but I do procrastinate in my music practice a lot I have a class on Saturday morning So Monday to Thursday If I have to submit something on Friday I do it procrastinate I dont consider it as important I mean stuff is lying everywhere but I dont think its Yes it would have been better it was those For example we prefer nonrediment nonrediment So basically maintenance task is basically going buying wheat and then going to Got Yeah I used to do it a lot before Once I understood that its not that difficult here theres a shop in Balchow so I could do it quickly Initially I mean My dad used to tell me dont eat this its ready made Like okay well I dont like personally I dont see them as very important So its only because my wife thinks theyre important I do But generally everything is In most cases its not important And its just Its not productive Like lets say you go and buy wheat and then wait for atta where you can get it in one click So its not productive Secondly just waiting time is everywhere So those I dont like So I usually then when I have to do an event glossary and all Then I would be like and just a grocery which is like Bangalore market which I went shopping Its very boring when I just go and then sit in a corner with my whatever podcast or whatever So all of these things are pretty boring to me I just feel like theyre not important So uh so or its primary and waiting time and all But if I lets say put up my podcasts and then go to a grocery shop then still okay And does Basically its a cause of problem it those For example my parents passport is very new now So I can do it Ive done it for myself But I know that agents charge a lot randomly for a simple thing like this Im still not doing it I feel like I should quickly get it done in a few hours But Im waiting My dad will ask some agent how much money will you charge If its a lot Ill do it Otherwise I wont So its like theres no deadline for PT But yes I have to send my parents out to travel But I havent planned for that either So its been 34 weeks I know of the fact that I have to renew my passport And Im just waiting for my dad to tell me next time Generally forms are boring only So like LinkedIn I have to update now And I have not updated from like cred time say like One and a half years back I left it Its empty The current one is also empty I have notes there Rough notes Whenever I left the company I took onepage notes of whatever I had done Metrics etc And But yeah putting it on LinkedIn is Its important I know Everybody will check my profile So I dont need it Mostly because its very affection related It should be good So yeah on traveling I usually dont like booking myself everything So I wait If its a group travel its best Well figure it out So uh but uh we gave you both of that He has discount They go they go Whats it on the site They cant I guess they put you on your card Whats up So um because of that type of person because then I have to like I can just go on a site and just book tickets and places because I can I will if I yeah But its this is how you people people goes to me Like when I bought my new phone for example some discount was there and some EMI card and rupees were getting saved I was like if you want to buy it lets buy it So I just paid the whole amount and then everybody else was like you could have easily said Got it Okay So these parts I didnt like bookings and all I think In that too you have to be very cognitive Where do you want to go You have to be very Like mindfully its not a bad plan So basically then post it to a weekend did it but yeah of course I did it prices No no Im just talking In general managing money Bill payments have become very easy personal In budgeting basically I just track whatever spend I do So immediately as soon as I spend something I put it into an app then budgeting I dont do so the other thing is investments I have a cousininlaw who is an expert so I would just talk to him and see what to do whatever he said I would just immediately do it On and on and on I dont think investment is such a hassle now What else Just one second change it Hello Yeah can you hear me Relatively lesser I give a lot of importance to it So in food probably yes If you want to eat a lot of protein and fiber what should you do I try to do exercise but usually not I like playing and exercising Of course theres natural procrastination there but in action its not there Every day I would exercise Lesser mostly because I get importance whatever So the broad goal is to increase the protein intake Like grams per day But for a long time its not happening I dont know the right path for it yet Being a vegetarian Sleep schedules is great Doctor appointments usually jabhi I think easy hota aaj kal phone pe ya call karke book kar lo No after appointments and sleep Sorry brushing bathing Grooming I procrastinate heavily I know if I groom its better but I dont do it often somebody else will tell me in two weeks that I have to go now I would be lazy in that Ill go I just find like going and wasting an hour on this Just lying just sitting there with a partner doing nothing Its just a waste of time Music yes So I know music is important it has improved also and it is if I do regularly it will its going to go up part of my entity also but uh but uh sportsman generally I dont uh I theres a group uh badminton group so I just join Reading used to be a hobby I dont read anymore I just dont know whats highest impact my reading What should I read which is best suited for me now will be helpful So after that deciding what to read is a very big risk Basically I could be improving a lot of things but what is the best way I dont know So I could look at videos but I dont So I could start building something I have started but usually I want to do more of it So usually a checklist I try to create but then dedicating the time doesnt happen Reading is not happening as a habit Then exercise Ive just stopped consciously because its easier than I thought Its alright So its I avoid them as far as Okay got it And until its like somebody whos listening to what I have to say I dont like that conversation You can take yeah Lets just say its between my wife and my parents And lets say shes displeased with something that I wanted And I feel thats right Its hard for me to tell my parents that because then its like yeah I think your parents uh basically Im taking aside and uh I dont want to go like you might Yeah Um uh so I uh Ive gotten better at it now I now I realize calling it out as far better keeping it uh at least in workplace where I know that people are more like But the tendency would be to avoid if you can Thats the tendency learn to at least consciously be important Is it the same with Ill just tell you its not friendship per se but its with you only So I didnt like the message you sent yesterday And I want to tell you Decisions for others I mean No you to Yeah like buying a house for example So many things need to be considered So many people I was at the back of my mind that housing rates will keep increasing But then I justified that no I am investing So its fine But I know back of my mind that housing is an important decision to be taken Some people Some people should take it now some people should take it later There are different opinions in the film as well I have my conditions So well see later Calls messages I respond usually Friends family meeting I am actually very active course probably in Delhi I dont talk often Its the primary complaint of everybody But I dont think its fine Its a good to have in my life but not a must have I dont think it helps me Okay high standards for my work Actually relatively if you say its not very high standards Of course I want to do better than what I do but its not perfectionist attitude like pixel level perfectionism This is true everyone delays but Relatively where I stand is where Yeah Yeah task Two Three Three could do I find One Three One me I face a lot of uncertainty and fear \\n wordsspeaker01 So let us start So initially I would like to define procrastination It is basically a voluntary delay in an intended course of action despite expecting or knowing to be worse off for the delay or it is knowing that you should be doing something and you are still putting it off again and again despite intending to complete any task or action What isnt procrastination Basically there might be things that you dont think are important like you dont consider them important and all so you deprioritize Thats not procrastination Its when you really want to do something but for whatever reason youre not doing it OK So typically there are certain categories of tasks that people regularly procrastinate So well be going through them And then you can reflect and let me know So in the first its workrelated tasks Under that there are reports presentations You have to regularly update some charts or trackers maintain some OKRs Do you tend to procrastinate in these work Okay Then there are quantitative aspects of work like calculations estimations doing some number grudging Do you tend to procrastinate in those I okay and then there are longterm planning tasks like you know project plans you have to design a strategy you have to do a lets say a PRD or stuff like that or for your job it might be some sprint planning and stuff like yeah So when you used to procrastinate right What did you find so difficult about it Like why did you put it off for later in that moment What were you thinking Got Got it Got it Okay And your daytoday tasks do you try to procrastinate in those things that you have to do daily at work lets say even today Theyre short like they might take some time and you know lets say brainless mundane tasks are repetitive Okay Then the next category is basically household So in that cleaning organizing stuff it could be your wardrobe it could be some other room it could be your own bedroom Do you Got it So it wont be procrastination important And does it affect you or do you think about it frequently Daily that I have to clean or I wish I could clean if clear What about maintenance tasks Lets say something is broken or you need to get something made so you have to call somebody and get these maintenance tasks done right Do you tend to procrastinate in it see well see And what about purchases for your houses There are both short and long term In short term of course like you mentioned there is flour groceries and stuff like that And long term its more like say bigger purchases for the house Maybe it could be some appliances or maybe even things like a car or yeah Short and long term it hard So what do you not enjoy about these tasks Like you mentioned you dont find them so what do you not enjoy about it Got it Okay it like personally it might not but does it affect you frequently in terms of your day to day life with people Lets say youre reminded of it or its causing a lot of conversations or friction and stuff like that So in that sense it might not honestly affect you because you dont find it important but does it that way affect and then you wish or tell yourself frequently that I wish I had done it Got Okay Then the next category is basically admin tasks So its like filling forms K by Cs It could be bank related tax related It could be reimbursements reconciliation Do you tend to delay Since how long have you procrastinated on this Or typically whats like the duration Is it a weeks thing Is it a months thing Can you think of some more tasks in this admin category where by some processes need to be done or forms need to be filled that you have procrastinated Like is it a tendency or this is a oneoff case Understood Okay Then the other thing under admin only right is like flight ticket bookings hotel bookings or like doing packing before trips Do you tend to procrastinate on any of these book yeah just yeah enjoy So this might have cost implications sometimes Lets say things are getting delayed especially with flights or something and then go up Then the next category is Yeah tell me Okay Then there are financial tasks right So here its like investments bill payments or budgeting for your own life Do you tend to procrastinate in these now Investments and money management in general or budgeting in your life so So in general in financial tasks do you tend to procrastinate I think overall you dont tend to in these So thats all right Ill Sure sure Yeah yeah tell me Yes Then the next category is health and fitness where there is exercising food and nutrition How is the procrastination on this But more on the food and nutrition front And do you think of it frequently Like does it is it something thats top of your mind Lets say daily or weekly I still wish to do this I wish to work on this or Then things like doctor appointments or like in general right Checkups and sleep schedules So in both of these basically you are not procrastinating Then there are hygiene tasks so things like bathing brushing grooming What about these and grooming in general right Hair care skin care whatever amount What do you find difficult in this Understood Okay And then there are things like personal development So people typically have hobbies like you mentioned music already but writing dancing sports etc Do you procrastinate on those uh any other hobbies that you can think of that youre procrastinating on Okay And then there are things like new skills or learning So people have selfimprovement goals for themselves whether its in their personal life whether its in their professional life that if they do something like this theyll improve or if any session they join theyll improve Do you tend to procrastinate on these Okay And then there are things like habits right So people want to build some new habits or break bad habits Are there any habits that youre procrastinating on Yeh karna tha kabse soch rahe ho but for whatever reason yeah not happening The next category is basically social tasks So if you have to do difficult conversations and confrontations be it at work in your personal life do you tend to delay those basically like difficult conversations you need to have or confrontations you need to do whether its in your workplace whether its in your personal life do you tend to delay those two later frequently Yeah possible Okay again what do you find so hard about it Why Like what do you find so hard I mean what are you thinking when youre dealing for it What do you not like about it What do you think is going to happen your time Think of some instances and Is it something be probably wary of upsetting them for no reason or just creating a rift which you dont want to do maintaining relationships stuff like that Okay got it Have you faced similar lets say issues at work with any of your lets say bosses or with your colleagues where you know things were difficult and you have you faced the same issues there And you can think back to CRED or even Indy or yeah Samsung friendships also Like any important conversation you need to have with someone but you have left it for later Then the next category basically is decisions involving other people So you might have to take a decision but you have to take consensus with many people It could be difficult it could be easy Do you tend to avoid or procrastinate on those have take a decision about something in your life or your work but it is going to involve taking consensus from multiple people Or yeah like you have to be to and fro with people You have to take the decision with input from multiple people So in that case do you So these are decisions which will involve other people You cant just take it on your own So do you tend to push those or delay those own Got it What about meeting friends and family responding to messages and calls Basically there is nothing in this Of So again you will not find it important but it will be similar because its them getting affected you will have to deal with it a lot And then the last category is basically long term planning strategies right So its like some people have these things they set goals they envision the future one year six months five year plans or you have to do big project plans or abstract goals basically where there are no deadlines right It could be regarding a personal life it could be the work life Do you tend to procrastinate in this Not that important to you Thats fine Then its not procrastination because you I mean youre not thinking about it You dont find it important Thats okay Okay So were done with the first part Well move to the second part Here Ill just be telling you a couple of statements and you need to tell me how much you agree or disagree with it or whether you find it neutral right Whether you relate to it or not Okay So I have very high standards for my work or tasks and I want to do them perfectly I have very I spend more time thinking analyzing all aspects about a problem or a decision and delay actually working on it No no So the second part of the exercise right its disconnected from the first So this is about you as a person in general in life And all of these right they are not patterns regarding all human beings So there are people who dont at all relate to these statements There are some who absolutely relate to these statements So we are going to look at you as a person Disconnect this from the first part completely And you just answer in general whether you relate to this statement or not So I spend more time I get stuck in thinking analyzing phase before doing a If I create something I rework redo edit it to make it better I delay starting or completing important tasks because I am afraid I will not do them well I get caught up in minute details of a project or decision and spend a lot of time over it I do endless planning and research before doing a task I realize I am getting delayed dont have enough time to finish the task I wish I had more time I struggle to delegate important tasks to others prefer to do them myself I tend to be late to many events even when I want to be on time Many times I experience a last minute rush in getting things done like getting ready for an outing completing a project near deadline I underestimate the time required for doing tasks and wish I had started earlier or planned better When I feel a task is too complex or difficult I delay it If I feel less capable of doing something I delay it I feel a temporary relief and calm from my stress when I delay tasks too later I feel a temporary relief or calm from my stress when I delay tasks to later I am easily distracted by new things I start multiple projects but rarely finish them I tend to prioritize immediate gains over longterm goals Im easily distracted by work or personal pings on WhatsApp or Slack or email or someone calling to talk Im easily distracted by social media I tend to do other tasks instead of the task I sat down to do I find it difficult to initiate tasks even simple ones due to feelings of some inertia or resistance I find it difficult to be patient and push some things to later even when I know I could do those things later it later but you find it difficult yeah I find it difficult to be patient and push some things to later even when I know I could do them later So basically you dont need to do them now you can do it later but you still find it difficult to push things for later I thrive on last minute pressure I find I do tasks very well in moment I intentionally leave things until deadline maybe to see how I do them I am calm under immense stress I get a rush working at deadlines and feel a sense of achievement when things get done I feel motivated and energized near deadlines I find it difficult to start tasks before deadlines I prefer to do them closer to deadlines I enjoy taking risks more than the average person and look for thrilling activities to do Many times I get work done when others are dependent on I work well with another person pushing me to start or finish things I face a lot of uncertainty or fear and prefer if someone can help me then And prefer if someone can help me then In general like is this a statement you relate to in decision making in life I like having guidance and directions from others I prefer working with people and in teams I tend to procrastinate more in independent situations or tasks that dont involve others I tend to seek approval or reassurance before doing things and that causes a lot of to and fro and delays I feel frozen when faced with large or complex tasks Many times I dont know where to start or how to break things down to make them easier to do I sometimes feel frozen even when faced with seemingly small tasks that seem overwhelming to me I sometimes feel frozen even when faced with seemingly small tasks that seem overwhelming to me I experience a lot of stress or dread when faced with tasks that seem insurmountable to me I feel deadlines arent important I believe most deadlines are flexible I question why I should do a task or the necessity of doing a task people tell me to do I dont do it if its not important Yeah I prefer being spontaneous do not like plans and timelines or structures Fine So you prefer plans and timelines and structures and do not prefer being spontaneous Yeah In many situations waiting for end moment is a sign of resourcefulness and cleverness It is needed to do some tasks well So we are done with this part\""

    "So mostly like, abhi toh hai nahin vysa thi but past mein it used to be around ki ek broad problem statement hai. So hai, toh hai, toh hai, toh hai, toh hai. So I'm not in that situation. I'm in that situation where I have to think about too many things, too many angles to be thought about. Toh hai, toh hai, toh hai. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:02:03\n",
    "So when you used to procrastinate, right, what did you find so difficult about it? \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:02:12\n",
    "Why did you put it off for later in that moment? What were you thinking? So usually like it requires a lot of attention and deep work kind of situation. Right? Toh. So I used to think about it like, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that. And then I would just like, just open, like start and then because it was probably not perfect, I would just go back to Twitter or WhatsApp or LinkedIn. Got it. And then get back and then again go back and so. So the mental energy, then my solution later sometimes was just kiya kuch bhi ho bas likhna chalu kar toh. Talk khulke. Hmm. So I used to think about it like, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that. And then I would just like, just open the door and then it will work out. Got it. So after some time I would start doing that. Got it. Just open a doc, start writing whatever thoughts and then create a structure first and then go through each part later. But basically without any expectations, just start writing work for me. Got it. Okay. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:03:14\n",
    "And jo day to day apke tasks hota hai, do you try to procrastinate and do the things that you have to do daily at work, let's say, even today? They are short, like they might take some time. And you know, let's say brainless, mundane tasks, they're repetitive. \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:03:27\n",

Got it. Got it. Okay. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:03:55\n",
    "Then the next category is basically household. Tosne cleaning, organizing stuff, it could be your wardrobe, it could be some other room, it could be your own bedroom. \n",

    "Do you procrastinate? I guess I don't consider it as important. Got it. \n",

    "I mean, stuff is lying everywhere but I don't think it's important. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:04:17\n",
    "Got it. And does it affect you or do you think about it frequently? Rose ki, arey sapka? Yaar fir kash mai sapkar leta? Aise kuch? Haan, matla better hota agar ye clear hota toh but nahin bhi hota toh theek. \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:04:24\n",
    "Okay. Got it. As if toh aata bhi theek hota toh acha. Got it. Okay. What about maintenance tasks? So let's say something is broken or you need to get something made so you have to call somebody and get these maintenance tasks done, right? Do you tend to procrastinate in those? Ummm, I think I do. I think I do. I think I do. \n",

    "SPEAKER 1 0:04:44\n",
    "Ummm, let's say for example we prefer like non-rediment aata, so basically maintenance tasks is basically going, buying wheat and then going to... Got it. Yeah, procrastination pehle toh kafi karta tha. So, I understood that it is not that difficult here. There are food shop and balsam. So, it is done quickly. Initially, my dad used to tell me that don't eat this, it is readymade. Like, okay, we will see. Okay. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:05:33\n",
    "And what about purchases for your houses? There are short and long term purchases. In short term, of course, like you mentioned, there is flour, groceries and stuff like that. And long term, it is more like bigger purchases for the house. Maybe it could be some appliances or maybe even things like a car or yeah. \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:05:49\n",
    "Short and long term. I don't like personally, I don't see them as very important. So, it is only because my wife thinks they are important. I do it. But personally, I don't think anything is important. Okay. But generally, everything is important. Got it. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:06:13\n",
    "So, what do you not enjoy about these tasks? Like you mentioned, you don't find anything. \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:06:18\n",
    "So, what do you not enjoy about it? Generally, like in most cases, it is not important. And it is just a productive time. Like let's say you go and buy wheat and then wait for atta. You can get it in one click. So, it is not productive. Secondly, just waiting time is everywhere. So, those I don't like. So, usually then when I have to go, even grocery and all, then I would be like. And just like grocery, if you get good in the market in Bangalore, then we will go there and bring it. So, it feels very boring. Even shopping feels very boring. Okay. And then I would go and then sit in a corner with my whatever podcast or Kindle or whatever. So, all of these things are pretty boring to me. I just feel like they are not important. So, valuably. So, that's primary and waiting time and all. But if I let say, okay, I put up my podcasts and then go to a grocery shop, then still okay. Got it. Okay. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:07:35\n",
    "And does it. Like personally, it might not. But does it affect you frequently in terms of your day to day life with people? Let's say you are reminded of it or it's causing a lot of conversations or frictions and stuff like that. So, in that sense, it might not honestly affect you because you don't find it important. But does it that way affect and then you wish or tell yourself frequently that I wish I did it. \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:07:59\n",
    "I wish I didn't have to do it. Basically, it's a cause of problem. Got it. Okay. Sometimes, yeah. Okay. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:08:09\n",
    "Then the next category is basically admin tasks. So, it's like filling forms, KYCs. It could be bank related, tax related. It could be reimbursements, reconciliation. Do you tend to, yeah, delay those? \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:08:22\n",
    "Yeah. So, just say for example, my parents passport is very new now. So, I can do it. I've done it for myself. But seriously, agent lagado. But I know that agents charge a lot randomly for example, things like this. I'm still not doing it. And I feel like I should quickly get it done in few hours. Got it. But I'm waiting that my dad will ask some agent that how much money they have taken and then if it's too much, I'll do it. Otherwise, I'll… \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:09:02\n",
    "Got it. So, how long have you procrastinated on this? Or typically what's like the duration? \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:09:07\n",
    "Is it a week's thing? \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:09:08\n",

    "SPEAKER 1 0:09:09\n",
    "So, it's like there's no deadline for PT. But yeah, I have to send my parents to go abroad. But I haven't planned for that either. So, it's been three, four weeks. I know of the fact that I have to renew my passport. Got it. And I'm just like waiting that next time my dad will ask me. Got it. So, I'll see. Got it. Till then it's all good. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:09:32\n",
    "Can you think of some more tasks in this admin category where some processes need to be done or forms need to be filled that you have procrastinated? Like is it a tendency or this is one of the case? \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:09:44\n",
    "Generally, forms are boring only. So, like LinkedIn I have to update now my profile. Okay. And I have not updated from like CRED time say like two, one and a half years back I left CRED. Yeah. Very empty. And the current one is also empty. So, there I have notes like rough notes. Whenever I left company I took like one page notes of whatever I had done metrics. Yeah. And but yeah, like LinkedIn is important. I know everybody will take my profile. So, I haven't done all that. Got it. Mostly because it's very affection related. Got it. So, I will just keep it to myself. Understood. Okay. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:10:33\n",
    "Then the other thing under admin only, right, is like flight ticket bookings, hotel bookings or like doing packing before trips. Do you tend to procrastinate on any of these? \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:10:42\n",
    "So, yeah. On traveling I usually don't like booking myself every week. So, I wait. If there is any group travel then we will figure it out. So, but this also happens a lot. That is also a lot. That is like look at the discounts, go there, go to different sites, ask someone about this card and all that. It's very boring. Got it. So, because of that I procrastinate because then I have to like I can't just go on a site and just book tickets and book places. Got it. Because I can if I go to a place. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:11:18\n",
    "Yeah, yeah. But it's just, yeah, this is how you work. \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:11:20\n",
    "People, people close to me are like, I always feel like when I bought my new phone for example, some discount was there and some EMI card and I thought that we were getting saved. As like buy karna hai, so fuck it, buy kar lete hai. So, I just paid the whole amount and everybody else was like, you could have easily said fight or die. Got it. Okay. So, these parts like bookings and all I think, usme bhi aap bahut saitha confident kao deyega hai ki I went to Dubai, kaha jaana hai. Then you have to be very like mindful. Koi bhi aisa gala planning toh nahi ho raha hai. So, I think a lot of eqo hai, figuring out. So, basically then, posted to a weekend, did it but haan of course I did enjoy it. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:12:05\n",
    "Toh iss se kabhi-kabi cost implications aate hokge. Let's say things are getting delayed. Especially with flights or something and then prices go up. \n",

    "SPEAKER 2 0:12:20\n",
    "You know, there are financial tasks, right. So, yaha pe it's like investments, bill payments or budgeting for your own life. So, then there are financial tasks, right. Do you tend to procrastinate in these? \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:12:28\n",
    "Like in general managing money. Bill payments have become very easy now. Hmm. Okay, aise toh aur kya? \n",

    "Investments and like, yeah. Planning. Investment and money management in general or budgeting in your personal life. \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:12:45\n",
    "So, budgeting mein basically I just track whatever spend I do. So, immediately as soon as I spend something I put into app. Then, I just track. Okay. In general budgeting I don't do. So, the other thing is. Investments and yeah. Investments ttoh it's I have a husband in law who is expert so I would just talk to him and say ki kya tanna hai. Whatever he said I would just immediately do it on and off. So, I don't think investment is such a hassle now. What else? Ya nahi. So, in general financial task mein yey tha, do you tend to procrastinate. I think overall you don't tend to in these. In general. In general. Yeah. So, this is the question. So, in general financial task mein yey tha, do you tend to procrastinate. I think overall you don't tend to in these. No. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:13:19\n",

    "just one second yeah I'll change it sure sure hello yeah yeah tell me yeah can you hear me \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:13:39\n",
    "yes yeah then the next category is health and fitness where you know there's exercising food \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:13:48\n",
    "and nutrition how's the procrastination on this relatively lesser I give a lot of importance to it so food meha probably yes the funny protein on a type of so yeah that's your skill what's up right to do excise may usually not I like being and exciting one because there's natural procrastination every night action makes not them every day I would excise so my lesser mostly because I get importance but more on \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:14:29\n",
    "the food and nutrition front and do you think of it frequently like does it is it something that's top of your mind let's say daily or weekly carry any more I I still wish to do \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:14:37\n",
    "this I wish to work on this or whatever so broad broad goal to a key protein but I put on a 60 per day but for a long time it's not happening it's like I don't know the right parts for it yet \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:14:57\n",
    "vegetarian being a vegetarian okay okay then then things like doctor appointments or like in \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:15:06\n",
    "general right checkups and sleep schedules sleep schedules is great doctor appointments usually happy I think easier that's gonna phone pay a call as they book hello so in both of these basically you are not procrastinating I know a performance and sleep okay then there are hygiene tasks so things like bathing brushing grooming what about these so the brushing and grooming in general \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:15:45\n",
    "right where care skincare job yeah \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:15:48\n",
    "I know if I go it's better but I don't do it often somebody else will tell me in two weeks that I have to go now I would be lazy in that amount what do you find difficult in this I just find that going and wasting an hour on this I just find that going and wasting an hour on this just lying like be just sitting there with the barber doing nothing just lying like be just sitting there with the barber doing nothing \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:16:24\n",
    "uh it's just based upon understood okay um and then there are things like personal development so people typically have hobbies like you mentioned music already but writing dancing sports etc do \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:16:37\n",
    "you procrastinate on those uh music yes uh so I know music is important but actually it has improved also and it is if I do regularly it will it's going to go up part of my identity also but uh that's where I go but sports may generally I don't uh I there's a group uh badminton group this is me too so I just joined uh no progress like that understood any other hobbies that you \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:17:13\n",
    "can think of that you're procrastinating on reading yes uh \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:17:18\n",
    "I don't know what what's highest impact uh in my reading what should I which is best to do for me I just don't know what what's highest impact uh in my reading what should I which is best to do for me now that will be helpful so after that are like deciding what to read is a very big risk \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:17:39\n",
    "okay um and then there are things like new skills or learning so people have self-improvement goals for themselves whether it's in their personal life whether it's in their professional life um \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:18:01\n",
    "so like I I basically I could be improving a lot of things but what is the best that I don't know so I could look at the videos but I don't um so I could start building something on my own uh so I have started but uh usually I want to do more of it um so usually uh checklists I try to create on my pillow but then uh dedicating the time doesn't happen okay and then there are things like habits right \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:18:41\n",
    "so people want to build some new habits or break bad habits uh other any habits that you're procrastinating on please so shop skewers \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:18:52\n",
    "um whatever comments okay yes no I've got to do it this kind of stuff right now I need to do this now because I have a team yes my friend has not even heard when you'll be guys started now or did you to fall for it and then uh think of reading recently yeah not happening but for whatever reason yeah not happening reading is not happening uh as a habit then um exercise I've just stopped consciously because it's goes you'll deny tonight so it's all right about that what else more weakness I think is important to stick to your reading etc yeah your feelings and when you think about it you'll learn it too soon... \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:19:17\n",
    "The next category is basically social tasks. So if you have to do difficult conversations and confrontations be it at work or in your personal life, do you tend to delay those? \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:19:32\n",
    "Social tasks? \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:19:33\n",
    "So is it basically like difficult conversations you need to have or confrontations you need to do whether it's in your workplace, whether it's in your personal life, do you tend to delay those too later frequently? \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:19:44\n",
    "Yeah, I avoid them as far as possible. Okay got it. Delay and until it's like somebody pushes me to do it I won't do it. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:19:55\n",
    "Again what do you find so hard about it? \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:19:58\n",
    "I don't like that conversation. Why? Like what do you find so hard? What are you thinking when you are delaying for later? What do you not like about it? \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:20:07\n",
    "What do you think is going to happen? \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:20:09\n",
    "You can take your time. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:20:13\n",
    "Think of some instances. \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:20:14\n",
    "Yeah. Let's just say it's between my wife and my parents and it's as if she's displeased with something and I feel that's right but it's hard for me to tell my parents that because then it's like yeah okay okay parents are doing it wrong. Okay. So basically I'm taking a side and that I don't want to throw. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:20:54\n",
    "Is it something like you might be probably wary of upsetting them for no reason or just creating a rift which you don't want to do, maintaining relationships, stuff like that? \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:21:03\n",
    "Yeah. Okay got it. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:21:05\n",
    "Have you faced similar let's say issues at work with any of your let's say bosses or with your colleagues where you know things were difficult and you have been able to deal \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:21:12\n",
    "with them? \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:21:13\n",
    "And you have faced the same issues there? And you can think back to cred or even Indy or yeah Samsung. \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:21:22\n",
    "So I have gotten better at it now. Now I realize calling it out is far better than keeping it at least in workplace where I know that people are more like more accepting of me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They also understand that calling it out earlier than later is better. So there I have started to get better. But yeah it happens little by little. But the tendency would be to avoid if you can. That's the tendency to avoid but learn to at least constantly be important. Okay. Is it the same with friendships also? Like any important conversation you need to have with someone but you know it's not always the same. Yeah. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:21:52\n",
    "Yeah. \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:21:53\n",
    "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:22:03\n",
    "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:22:06\n",
    "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:22:09\n",
    "Yeah. \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:22:10\n",

    "SPEAKER 2 0:22:40\n",
    "what so you do it's like a tendency then the next the next category basically is decisions involving other people right so you might have to take a decision but you have to take consensus with many people it could be difficult it could be easy do you tend to avoid or procrastinate on those decisions for others about something in your life or your work but it is going to involve taking consensus from multiple people or yeah like to and fro with people you have to take the decision with input from multiple people so in that case do you so these are decisions which will involve other people you can't just take it on your own so do you tend to push those or delay those \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:23:26\n",
    "like buying a house for example so many things need to be considered so many people but there are different opinions about housing I also had the lack of moment that the rates will keep increasing but then I just decided to keep investing so it's fine like it's going on but I know back of the moment that housing is an important decision to be taken that we shouldn't take it now some people would be like we should take it now some people would be like we should take it later then we should have different opinions about it my own conditions are different as well so I will keep it closed \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:24:14\n",
    "what about meeting friends and family responding to messages and calls \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:24:18\n",
    "calls messages I respond usually friends family meeting I am actually very active \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:24:30\n",
    "so basically there is nothing in this there is no \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:24:34\n",
    "of course in the family yes there is some that I don't talk often it's the primary complaint of everybody so I don't think it's fine \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:24:44\n",
    "so again you will not find it important but it will be similar because it's them getting affected you will have to deal with it a lot \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:24:51\n",
    "yeah ok \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:24:54\n",
    "and the last category is basically long term planning strategies right so it's like some people have these things they set goals they envision the future one year six months five year plans or you have to do big project plans or abstract goals basically where there are no deadlines right it could be regarding a person life it could be the work life do you tend to procrastinate in these \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:25:15\n",
    "it's a good to have in my life but not a must have got it not that important to you I don't think it helps me take care that's fine \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:25:26\n",
    "then it's not procrastination because you I mean you are not thinking about it you don't find it important that's ok \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:25:31\n",
    "yeah \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:25:32\n",
    "ok so we are done with the first part we will move to the second part here I will just be telling you a couple of statements and you need to tell me how much you agree or disagree with it or whether you find it neutral right whether you relate to it or not \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:25:44\n",
    "ok \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:25:45\n",
    "ok so I have very high standards for my work or tasks and I want to do them perfectly \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:25:50\n",
    "ok 1 to 5 I can \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:25:55\n",
    "yeah kind of so you can just say yeah like yes relate to very much or no or neutral \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:26:02\n",
    "I have very high standards for my work actually I don't have any actually relatively if you say it's not very high standards so of course I want to do better than what I do but it's not perfectionist attitude like pixel level perfectionism I would say 3 or so 3.5 \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:26:23\n",
    "ok I spend more time thinking analyzing all aspects about a problem or a decision and delay actually working on it \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:26:31\n",
    "ummm I am not sure what you meant by that just so you understand it's a natural tendency but relatively ah not much so 2 OK so whether I am answering based on ah this is true because everyone is always delaying but \n",
    "SPEAKER 2 0:27:00\n",
    "relatively where I stand is where no no so the so the second part of the exercise right is disconnected from the first So this is about you as a person in general in life. And all of these, right, they are not patterns regarding all human beings. So there are people who don't at all relate to these statements. There are some who absolutely relate to these statements. So we are going to look at you as a person, disconnect this from the first part completely. And you just answer in general whether you relate to this statement or not. So I spend more time... I get stuck in thinking, analyzing phase before doing a task. \n",
    "SPEAKER 1 0:27:35\n",
    "Okay. \n",
